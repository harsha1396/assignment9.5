1)Explain the core components of flume:-

The core components of Flume are:-
Event:The single log entry or unit of data that is transported.
Source:This is the component through which data enters Flume workflows.
Sink:It is responsible for transporting data to the desired destination.
Client:The component that transmits event to the source that operates with the agent.
Agent:Any JVM that runs Flume.
Channel:It is the duct between the Sink and Source.

2)Can flume provide 100% reliability while transfering the data:-

Apache Flume provides end to end reliability because of its transactional approach in data flow.
Flume uses channel-based transactions to guarantee reliable message delivery.
This channel is responsible to pass reliably from end to end flow.

3)Explain the consolidation in flume:-

Consolidation in Flume collects data from different sources and from different Flume agents.
Flume sources collects data from different sources and they flow through channel and sink.
The collected data is send to HDFS or the target destination.

4)Explain what is an event in flume:-

An Event is a unit of data that flows through a Flume agent.
The Event flows from Source to Channel to Sink and is represented by an implementation of the Event interface.
An Event carries a payload that is accompanied by an optional set of headers. 
Events flows from an external source to a external destination.

5)Explain what is an agent in flume:-

A Flume agent is a process that hosts the components through which events flow from an external source to the external destination.
The events are staged in a channel on each agent. 
Flume agent configuration is stored in a local configuration file.
